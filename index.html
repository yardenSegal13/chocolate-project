      <h3>The cacao beans</h3>
      <p>
        The fruit of the cocoa tree is the cocoa pod which contains cocoa beans.
        After being harvested, the beans are going through a Fermentation
        process and drying process which takes in total around 3 weeks. Those
        process are giving the cocoa beans less bitter flavor and lowers their
        humidity level so they could be kept for long time and be transported.
        Before being transported, the beans undergo a quality check. They are
        then being pounded and stomped to remove the shells. The beans, which
        from then on are considered "tradable cocoa", are being shipped by boat
        and delivered to the processing countries.
      </p>
      <h4>The chocolate process</h4>
      <p>
        The beans are getting roasted and then grounded into a dough. The dough
        is kneaded in a machine and a thick paste is formed - that is the cocoa
        mass. It is the main ingredient in chocolate. The cocoa mass is the raw
        material for cocoa powder, cocoa butter and chocolate. The cocoa mass
        contains about 55% fat. That fat is the cocoa butter, and it is pressed
        from the mass. There remains a dry, rock hard chocolate cake that
        contains 10 to 24 percent fat. This is ground into cocoa powder. So,
        what's in the chocolate that we're going to eat? </br> </br>
        <p>
        Dark chocolate- cocoa mass + sugar.<br />
        Milk chocolate-cocoa mass + milk powder + sugar.<br />
        White chocolate- cocoa butter + milk powder + sugar . <br /><br /></p>
